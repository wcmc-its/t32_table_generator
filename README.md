# T32 Table Generator

## Background 

The National Institutes of Health funds institutions to train predoctoral and postdoctoral students using the [T32 training grant program](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/training-grants/T32)

Institutions which apply for and receive these funds need to fill out and update a series of standard tables. The exact tables that need to be completed depend on which type of program an institution offers. Predoctoral training programs need to fill out tables in the "A" series, e.g., Table 5A. Postdoctoral students require tables be completed in the "B" series, e.g., Table 5B.

The T32 Table Generator is a set of MySQL queries and sample database that allows you to produce Table 5A for a T32 training grant.
